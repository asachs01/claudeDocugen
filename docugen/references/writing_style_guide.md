# Technical Writing Style Guide for DocuGen

This guide defines the writing standards for documentation generated by DocuGen.

## Voice and Tone

### Use Active Voice and Imperative Mood
- **Good**: "Click the **Submit** button to save your changes."
- **Avoid**: "The Submit button should be clicked to save your changes."

### Be Direct and Concise
- Target reading level: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 7-8
- Maximum 25 words per step instruction
- Focus on one action per step

### Write for the Reader
- Use "you" to address the reader directly
- Assume competence but not prior knowledge
- Explain the "why" alongside the "what"

## Step Structure

### Step Titles
- Start with an action verb
- Keep to 5-7 words maximum
- Be specific about the outcome

**Examples:**
- Access the project settings
- Create a new repository
- Configure notification preferences

### Step Descriptions
Each step should include:
1. **Context**: Why this step matters
2. **Action**: What to do (using bold for UI elements)
3. **Location hint**: Where to find the element

**Template:**
```
[Context sentence explaining purpose]. Click **[Element Name]** in the [location].
```

### Expected Results
- State what the user should see after completing the step
- Be specific about visual confirmation
- Use present tense

**Example:**
"The project dashboard displays with your new project listed at the top."

## Formatting Conventions

### UI Elements
- **Bold** for clickable elements: buttons, links, menu items
- Use exact text as it appears in the UI
- Include icon descriptions if relevant: "Click the **gear icon** (Settings)"

### User Input
- `Monospace` for text the user types
- Indicate placeholder text: "Enter `your-project-name`"

### File Paths and Code
- Use `code formatting` for file paths: `src/components/Header.tsx`
- Use code blocks for multi-line content

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Format as: `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`
- Provide both Windows and Mac alternatives when applicable

## Structure Guidelines

### Prerequisites Section
- List all requirements before starting
- Include account types, permissions, or roles needed
- Note required software or browser versions

### Procedure Length
- Target 7-12 steps per procedure
- Break longer procedures into sub-sections
- Use headings to create logical groupings

### Screenshots
- Every significant step should have a screenshot
- Caption format: "Step X: Brief action description"
- Alt text must describe the visual content

## Common Patterns

### Warning Callouts
Use for:
- Actions that can't be undone
- Required permissions or access
- Common mistakes to avoid

**Format:**
```
> **Warning**: This action cannot be undone. Make sure you've saved your work.
```

### Tips and Notes
Use for:
- Helpful shortcuts
- Alternative methods
- Related information

**Format:**
```
> **Tip**: You can also access this menu by right-clicking.
```

## Troubleshooting Section

### Issue Format
```
**[Issue Title - what the user sees]**
[What caused this and how to fix it]
```

### Common Patterns
1. Permission errors → Check account role
2. "Not found" errors → Verify URL/path
3. Validation errors → Check input format

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing documentation:
- [ ] All steps use imperative mood
- [ ] UI elements are in bold
- [ ] Each step has one primary action
- [ ] Expected results are specific
- [ ] Screenshots are annotated
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers common issues
- [ ] Reading level is appropriate (Grade 7-8)
