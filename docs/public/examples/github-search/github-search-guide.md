# Search for Repositories on GitHub

## Overview

Learn how to use GitHub's search feature to find repositories, code, and projects. GitHub search supports advanced filters and syntax for precise results.

## Prerequisites

- Web browser with internet access
- GitHub account (optional, but recommended for saving searches)

## Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to GitHub Search

GitHub's dedicated search page provides a clean interface for finding repositories, code, issues, and more. The search box accepts both simple queries and advanced syntax.

**Expected result:** The GitHub search page loads with an empty search box ready for input.

### Step 2: Enter your search query

Type keywords that describe what you're looking for. GitHub searches repository names, descriptions, README files, and code by default.

**Expected result:** Search results appear showing matching repositories sorted by best match. The sidebar shows filters for narrowing results by type, language, and more.

## Troubleshooting

**No results found**
Your search terms may be too specific or contain typos.
Try broader keywords, check spelling, or use GitHub's search syntax like `in:readme` to search specific fields.

**Too many results**
Generic search terms return thousands of results.
Use filters in the sidebar (language, stars, recently updated) or add qualifiers like `stars:>100` to your query.

**Can't find code snippets**
By default, search returns repositories, not code.
Click 'Code' in the left sidebar or add `type:code` to your search query.
